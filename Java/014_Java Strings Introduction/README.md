## Description of the problem
There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B.
For the second line, write Yes if A is lexicographically greater than B otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

### Sample Input
> hello
> java

### Sample Output
> 9
> No
> Hello Java

### Explanation
String A is "hello" and B is "java".

A has a length of 5, and B has a length of 4; the sum of their lengths is 9.
When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" precedes "java"; therefore, A is not greater than B and the answer is No.
When you capitalize the first letter of both A and B and then print them separated by a space, you get "Hello Java".
